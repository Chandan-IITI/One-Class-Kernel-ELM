There are 3 types of demo file given. But execution of any demo file, you will have need of DD Toolbox and PR Toolbox, which can be donloaded from the following links:

DD Toolbox:   http://prlab.tudelft.nl/david-tax/dd_tools.html

PR Toolbox:   http://prtools.org/software/


Add both toolboxes into the MATLAB path and then execute the demo codes, they will work perfectly fine.
